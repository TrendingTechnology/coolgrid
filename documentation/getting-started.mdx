# Getting started

Coolgrid is ultra flexible and extensible grid system for React
based on styled-components and heavily inspired by
Bootstrap Grid system.

## Motivation

There are several grid solutions but none of them have fit my
needs so far. They were not enough extensible. With Coolgrid
you can do basically whatever you want while writing less code
and have less dom elements in your application.

## Installation

You can install ii with your preferred tool (`yarn` or `npm`).

```powershell
# with yarn
yarn add coolgrid

# or with npm
npm install coolgrid --save
```

## Dependencies

Coolgrid depends on the following packages which need to be installed as well.

|                   |         |
| ----------------- | ------- |
| react             | >= 16.3 |
| styled-components | >= 4    |

## ThemeProvider

Don't forget to add coolstyle config into your `ThemeProvider` under `grid` key.

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components'
import { theme } from 'coolstyle

// you can import default bootstrap theme settings or create yours.
<ThemeProvider theme={{ grid: theme }}>
  {/* ...your components */}
</ThemeProvider>
```

## Code examples

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Container, Row, Col } from 'coolgrid'

const Element = () => (
  <Container>
    <Row>
      <Col size={3}>Column 1</Col>
      <Col size={{ xs: 12, sm: 6, md: 3 }}>Column 2</Col>
      <Col size={{ xs: 9, md: 3 }}>Column 3</Col>
      <Col size={3}>Column 4</Col>
    </Row>
  </Container>
)
```

You can define Col properties in Container or Row component.
It uses context in the background. It means you can even
write less code.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Container, Row, Col } from 'coolgrid'

const Element = () => (
  <Container>
    <Row size={{ xs: 12, sm: 6, md: 3 }}>
      <Col>Column 1</Col>
      <Col size={4}>Column 2</Col>
      <Col>Column 3</Col>
      <Col size={3}>Column 4</Col>
    </Row>
  </Container>
)
```
